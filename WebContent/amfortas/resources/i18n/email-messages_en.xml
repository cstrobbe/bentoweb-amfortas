Dear sir, madam,

Recently you registered yourself as a test candidate for the BenToWeb user tests, for which we would like to thank you.

This way we announce you that the test environment is online at http://bentoweb.org/amfortas/home.html and your account has been activated. You can now log in with your username and password, after which you can participate in the tests.

Please be aware that possibly not all tests are online yet and new ones are regularly added. Therefore it is advised to check this regularly. It can also occur that for certain user profiles less than 20 tests are available, in that case you are entitled to the minimum reimbursement.

We wish you lots of success with the tests. Don't hesitate to contact us should you experience any problems or have any questions in this regard.

Kind regards,

Tony Verelst, ISdAC
